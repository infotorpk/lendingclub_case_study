**Problem Statement**

**Business Understanding**

We work in a consumer finance company where we lend loans for various types of urban customers​

Company has to take decision on loan approval based on applicants profile.​

We have data set which has details about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. ​

The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.​

**Business Objectives​**


Lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss .​

Borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. ​

The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.
